# Python Wrapper for Visual Crossing Weather API

This Python Wrapper retrives data from the [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) API. Visual Crossing has an extensive Weather API for both historical and forecast weather data, and they have a Free Tier API Key which enables up to 1000 calls per day.

In order to get started you must create an Account with Visual Crossing and then create an API Key. You do this by accessing [this website](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data-editions) and clicking on the **Free** plan. Then follow the instructions to create and account and store your key in a safe place.

## Usage

Install the module by using this command in a terminal: `pip install pyVisualCrossingUK`

And then see `test_module.py` and `async_test_module.py` for usage examples, both standard and async. (Async example not yet created)

## Parameters

```python
# Initialise the module
vcapi = VisualCrossing(
    api_key,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    days=7,
    language="da"
)
````

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `api_key` | Yes      | `None`  | This is the API Key you signed up for from Visual Crossing. See above for instructions |
| `latitude` | Yes     | `None`  | Latitude for the location position |
| `longitude` | Yes     | `None`  | Longitude for the location position |
| `days` | No     | `14`  | Numbers of days to retrieve forecast for. 14 days means today plus the next 14 days. On the Free plan, this is the maximum number of days |
| `language` | No     | `en`  | The language in which text strings should be returned. Se below for list of valid languages. |
| `session` | No     | `None`  | A session variable. Only used when using the async function. |

## TODO

- Add all available items to the Data Structure
- Create `async_test_module.py` in the samples directory
